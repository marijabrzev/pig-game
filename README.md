Rules:
Player 1 will start the game. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold" and end their turn: If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they receive no points for the turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and they can choose to either roll again or hold.

If they choose to hold, their turn total is added to their score, and the turn ends. Players can also choose to use additional rules or variations, such as requiring a minimum score to start adding to their total, playing with two or more dice, or allowing the option to "double" or "triple" their score with certain rolls.

The first player to reach 100 or more points will win.

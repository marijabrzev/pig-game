      <h1><b>Objective:</b><br /></h1>
      <p>
        The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a total
        score of 100 or more points.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <h1><b>Rules:</b><br /></h1>
      <p>
        Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or
        the player decides to "hold" and end their turn: If the player rolls a
        1, their turn ends and they receive no points for the turn. If the
        player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and they
        can choose to either roll again or hold.
        <br /><br />
        If they choose to hold, their turn total is added to their score, and
        the turn ends. Players can also choose to use additional rules or
        variations, such as requiring a minimum score to start adding to their
        total, playing with two or more dice, or allowing the option to "double"
        or "triple" their score with certain rolls.
